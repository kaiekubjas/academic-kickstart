Since 2017 I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis at Aalto University. I received my PhD in mathematics in 2013 from Freie Universit√§t Berlin under supervision of Christian Haase and Klaus Altmann. As a postdoctoral researcher I visited Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, Aalto Science Institute, Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, MIT and Sorbonne University. 

I work in the field of applied algebraic geometry. I am particularly interested in algebraic statistics and applications in biology, for example in phylogenetics and 3D genome reconstruction. I am also interested in different problems related to matrices and tensors, e.g. nonnegative rank, positive semidefinite rank and low-rank matrix/tensor completion. Besides algebraic geometry, I like to use tools from combinatorics, polyhedral geometry and convex optimization.

Thanks to Academy of Finland for funding my research through project funding for early-career researchers!
