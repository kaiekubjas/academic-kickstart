Title: Introduction to graphical continuous Lyapunov models

Abstract: Stationary distributions of multivariate diffusion processes have recently been proposed as probabilistic models of causal systems in statistics and machine learning. By assuming each observation to arise as a one-time cross-sectional snapshot of a temporal process in equilibrium, they allow to model dependence structures that may include feedback loops. Specifically, the graphical continuous Lyapunov model consists of steady-state distributions of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes where sparsity assumptions on the drift matrices are represented with a directed graph. These distributions are Gaussian with covariance matrices that are parametrized as solutions of the continuous Lyapunov equation. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the model with a focus on the conditional independence structure as well as identifiability of the drift parameters in specific cases.

Title: Scenes over non-generic pictures of hypergraphs

Abstract: The central problem in scene analysis is finding the space of d-dimensional polyhedral caps with a fixed projection to (d-1)-dimensional space. In particular, we are interested in which sets of points in (d-1)-dimensional space are the projections of non-trivial polyhedral caps, in the sense that the hyperplanes of the polyhedral cap are distinct. Given the combinatorial structure of the polyhedral cap, studying the space of d-dimensional polyhedral caps with a fixed generic projection becomes a combinatorial problem. Specifically, liftings of generic projections can be studied via a lifting matrix. Whiteley characterised independence in the row-matroid of the lifting matrix for generic projections. The dual problem to studying scenes over generic projections is the problem of studying the space of parallel redrawings of hyperplane arrangements. In this talk, we will focus on liftability of non-generic projections, or, dually, parallel redrawings of non-generic hyperplane arrangements. For a class of polyhedral caps, we will see that the set of projections that lift to non-generic polyhedral caps with the correct combinatorial structure is given as the zero-set of a single polynomial, called the pure condition. We will see some basic properties of the pure condition, and how to easily compute it. The talk will be based on joint work with Daniel Bernstein.
