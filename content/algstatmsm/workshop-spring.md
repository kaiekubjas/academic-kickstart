This workshop will be held at Aalto University and the University of Helsinki from April 1–4, 2025, bringing together experts in algebraic statistics and survival and event history analysis. The primary goal is to introduce participants to the fundamental concepts of both fields. The program includes introductory mini-courses on April 2–3, while April 1 and 4 will focus on discussions aimed at fostering connections between the two areas. This workshop is open to researchers at all levels who are interested in exploring the intersection of algebraic statistics and survival and event history analysis.
