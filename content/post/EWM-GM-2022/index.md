We organized the [European Women in Mathematics General Meeting 2022](https://www.europeanwomeninmaths.org/activities/all-our-activities/gm2022/) at Aalto University during August 22-26, 2022. The conference had 129 participants from 25 countries. The EWM GM 2022 had 3 lectures by the European Mathematical Society lecturer Claire Voisin and five plenary lectures by Kathrin Bringmann, Maria Bruna, Nina Holden, Kaisa Miettinen, and Ilaria Perugia. There were also 13 minisymposia, a poster session, and an art and math workshop on building origami by Kirsi Peltonen. The gender issues in mathematics were discussed during a panel discussion and women in mathematics were highlighted during [Women of Mathematics from Around the World](https://womeninmath.net) exhibition. Diane Maclagan and Veronica Felli were elected as successors to Andrea Walther and myself to take over the roles of the convenor and deputy convenor of EWM. Many thanks to Karin Baur, Elena Resmerita, Andrea Walther and the local organizing team including Olga Kuznetsova for all the work! The conference was supported by [Aalto Science Institute](https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-science-institute-asci), [Federation of Finnish Learned Societies](https://www.tsv.fi/en) and [Foundation Compositio Mathematica](https://compositio.nl).
