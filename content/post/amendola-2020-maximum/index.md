title: "Maximum likelihood estimation of toric Fano varieties"
subtitle: ""
summary: "In the joint work with Carlos Améndola and Dimitra Kosta we study the maximum likelihood estimation problem for all 2-dimensional Gorenstein toric Fano varieties, we explore the reasons for the ML degree drop and we prove a result about the multiplicativity of ML degrees of codimension zero toric fiber products. This article appeared in the first volume of *[Algebraic Statistics](https://msp.org/astat/2020/11-1/index.xhtml)*. This first volume is numbered 11 to honour the past work of the algebraic statistics community."
