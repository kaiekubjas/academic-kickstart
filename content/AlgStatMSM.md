Workshop on Algebraic statistics and multistate models
Aalto University and University of Helsinki
April 1-4, 2025

As a part of the seed funding to boost collaboration between Aalto, KU Leuven and University of Helsinki (UH), the project “Algebraic Statistics and the Study of Multistate Models: Theory and Applications” organises the first workshop on Algebraic statistics and multistate models.

The Aalto and UH workshop on  Algebraic statistics and multistate models (1-4 April, 2025) will bring together experts in the areas of algebraic statistics and geometry, and survival and event history analysis. The main purpose of the workshop is to learn the baisc concepts of both these fields. Three resource persons will give mini courses on these topics on 2-3 April, 2025. The workshop is suitable for researchers of all levels who are interested in learning about the emerging field of algebraic statistics and geometry, and/or about survival and event history analysis (an ever growing multi-disciplinary field of statistics). At the end of the workshop, participants will be familiar with both the fields and able to connect the two fields for possible future research ideas.
